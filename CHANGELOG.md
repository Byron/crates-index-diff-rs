## 11.1.2 (2022-09-01)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-23a66b9da25ef40d4e545bed028788f83836a584/> make fetches work again by using safe-performance mode of `git-repository`.
   This fixes the 'zlib stream broken' issue when fetching crates.io
   changes which was caused by `git-repository` configuring for
   max-performance by default, which affects a crate used by `git2` as
   well. For some reason, changing to `zlib-ng` as backend wasn't taken
   kindly by `libgit2` causing it to fail after a short while of receiving
   a pack from the remote.
   
   The fix avoids making such modifications to the zlib crate, allowing
   both crates, `git-repository` and `git2` to co-exist in the same
   dependency tree.

## 11.1.1 (2022-08-31)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-28de9d4a6385bd495dbf93ef0d2b58e00e993104/> Consider all crates yanked if 'yanked = true'.
   Previously, due to a missing test, a bug snuck in that would assume
   that all lines in an added files must be new versions, marking them
   as `Change::Added`. This ignored the fact that any line could also
   carry a yanked crate, misrepresenting them.
   
   This is now fixed, and yanked crates generally show up as
   `Change::Yanked`.
   
   One might take this as a hint that diffentiating by yank status might
   not be that useful after all as it doesn't scale that well. Maybe
   a future version changes how `Change` is represented.

## 11.1.0 (2022-08-30)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-09489ab888124954119c70a5828f0e1011198253/> make the name of the remote configurable.
   This is primarily used in testing and we try even harder to make it fail
   to deal with squashed remote references, but it seems to work fine.
   
   For good measure, now using `+` in the refspec to assure it forces
   an update.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-cdcac4127490713de60e19d007ebcac0a2459c0d/> assure refs can be reet when fetching to support squashing.
   Previously tests didn't replicate this, now they do.

## 11.0.0 (2022-08-28)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2d3a182819077a1fe068cb16fdfeceed2f6882da/> Use `gitoxide` `Repository` instead of `git2::Repository`
   This comes with plenty of changes to the API of the
   `last_seen_reference()` and to the lower-level methods that take
   object ids (now `git::hash::ObjectId`.
   
   Note that `git2` is still used internally for fetching and cloning.
   This change was made to assure that at no time there are two open
   repositories (once for git2, once for `gitoxide`), as this has the
   potential to double resource usage for file handles.
 - <csr-id-07f4b6c022ae8c48907250314db3a9eeb59ae89e/> move `CloneOptions` into `index` module.
   The `index` module is now public for that reason.

## 10.0.0 (2022-05-23)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-38319375d07ca5d09700d40a778c367564cd8a66/> Add support for detecting deleted crates.
   Previously there was no need to do that as deletions couldn't happen -
   crates are yanked instead.
   
   Now that the ecosystem experienced its first (known) supply-chain attack
   crates can also be deleted and we should be able to detect that to allow
   downstream users to act on this automatically.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d273245d99836ef799946373444a0b85e02523d0/> update version in usage example

### New Features

 - <csr-id-accb62d00618204e76659ecb4d31e8a04291bdc5/> using openssl file as basis

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-cdfc689aacd68dd53ecef19187d1a02de84a8ab7/> give up on osx
   Openssl can't be linked due to missing symbols, no matter what.
   
   Maybe ... the version is too new?
   Odd that it works locally though.

 - <csr-id-36b79decb47d541172fffcbf6b43c60ab5bdd8d5/> openssl setup from openssl-rs itself

 - <csr-id-714d7cf2ce6de29a5021cf5c2c85e5b14631e203/> enforce more recent openssl lib
   Currently some symbols are missing or are named differently.
   Let's also see if it links it to the correct spot in /usr/local/opt/openssl
 - <csr-id-ae26330ee78be142f63c41d303a8ac604083880e/> only 1.1.0c seems to be working
   See
 - <csr-id-959fde03288238dc74ec82ebb2a949e834481ed2/> remove 32 bit targets due to failure
   The previous version triggered this error:
   Error parsing appveyor.yml: Value can be either string or "secure" string. (Line: 5, Column: 7)
 - <csr-id-f4ea940e9e8f6adc6a82a45adebecf01c26b7851/> attempt to set OPENSSL env vars
 - <csr-id-05bffd68e3411ca4327c7a905c9a4e562c9c2eb3/> try to allow 32 bit failures
   Could also remove them, but ideally it remains visible to maybe
   one day work.
 - <csr-id-b11f6df25e6a12e4835f32b739b7c7fd890d6c23/> try without index-bare cache
   For now ... I have not seen it being cloned at all.
   Possibly the cache provides a none-empty directory ?

 - <csr-id-a052f41cd198b7342b14aba186a955067a9a7241/> let's hope it will actually run now

 - <csr-id-24c1c81d7e1287ed83308f4f8ad795dfca4de834/> remove debug prints
 - <csr-id-9ef08fa5d1517883cb006fda522d020767f8d081/> remove error handling in makefile
   This isn't a good thing to do for all of those without cargo.
   However, let's see if it fixes the issue first.
 - <csr-id-42e1290ea75ddf57948b6f6acd23c2c17544db06/> to work with GNU make
 - <csr-id-f89651be89638e8210b74dc8843d5985d28e842b/> finally the correct refspec
   Fair enough, need trees here after all!
 - <csr-id-d0d43071a3fdcd795a2460b71363545dbf5a2a89/> cmake binary installation
 - <csr-id-f9f67efd7ca12c34d4bbfa171b8604f206d686b4/> use different cmake source
 - <csr-id-a97813620f5990f4d62337e7a6a8c3b3aadd05ef/> cmake upgrade via before_script
 - <csr-id-77bbd20132b7f42dd79b55f86c000f21618d4c39/> see if a custom source will get latest cmake
 - <csr-id-2d0d5d94193d5a65cdac700d811e9d75e849a7c9/> enforce latest cmake

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-601dc2d7ca9bd87f440455e1eb3698c6e2f0227d/> don't enforce branches
   Previously valid ref-names would be interpreted as branches, which
   limits their use despite the name indicating otherwise.
   
   Now every ref path is supported.
 - <csr-id-ef5349677d53ab2d31c921b853766a8aa21f59fa/> use quick-error
   That way, the crate-error type is an actual error with
   all the relevant implementations.
   
   It's impossible to work without it, I think :).
 - <csr-id-97a5b819df11a454f5154ae3edd5e4a03192c0e1/> move crate into own module
 - <csr-id-81c95f2a9014ace72e74da64ddb4840197d7bbec/> better diff.print implementation
 - <csr-id-988b66860a96411f9c263c582159066970ef9265/> simplify fetch-changes error handling
 - <csr-id-caa58790f61ec4e450dadbf737a0bc3224f8c0b4/> much nicer Crate from json
   It's good to know that we can chain everything, but that
   should only be done if there is an actual dependency of the
   respective values.
   
   Otherwise, just abort early.
 - <csr-id-b0dd2770a979b278e8be4432418367c6d9620c67/> better error handling
 - <csr-id-eee513476d300c294272e0c23348cdbc1009f008/> allow direct usage of objects as well

### Test

 - <csr-id-42e68031d586109efe7d9567279af4d4bf7ac0be/> remove duplicate
   all crates are also iterated in the
   'changed_since_last_fetch' test.
 - <csr-id-d06c4a0bb526eafb13a61951cd34c24febd10797/> fetch_changes()
   Just the frame and all testing I could think of
 - <csr-id-97b417ad71b3070e3663d1ce6d998f24a0bf1365/> assure we can handle the entire index
 - <csr-id-fdf281ee3b301ab370fe1d3ea6aeb1dd5e0536d1/> first clone on demand
   Would be nice to be able to specify --depth as well.
 - <csr-id-1c0b2c0a3723afd587779880337f5a5516c063f1/> first failing test
